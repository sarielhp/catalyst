# Motion Planning Experiment: Funnels

## Environment
- **Description**: A 2D bounding box with a sequence of walls separating it along the y-axis. Every wall has some number of funnel-shaped passages with an opening of length 1 above the wall (thin part), which widens to 3 as it reaches the wall (wide part).
- **Bounding box dimensions**: 70 x 70

## Robot
- **Type**: 3DOF mobile robot
- **Shape**: Rectangular prism with dimensions 0.6x2

## Task
- **Start**: A randomly generated configuration on the top side of the environment (high y-coordinate).
- **Goal**: A randomly generated configuration on the other side of the environment (low y-coordinate).

## Notes
### Environment generation
- **Python script**: The environment is generated by a python script called serial_funnels.py in the env directory.
- **Usage**: python serial_funnels.py <num_walls><br>
  Where <num_walls> is an integer. The script will then prompt the user for the number of funnels in each wall.
- **Notice**: The script is not robust. A large number of walls and/or funnels will lead to unusable results.
